## ðŸ›  How to Interact

### Using Hardhat Scripts:
```bash
# Deploy contract (already done)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-fresh.ts --network rskTestnet

# Verify contract on block explorer
npx hardhat verify --network rskTestnet 0x10F36d94Fb5E7Cd964E277e9475b0f139E475A34

# Test ABI integration
npx ts-node scripts/test-abi-integration.ts
```

### Using Frontend:
The ABI is available at `frontend/lib/abis/InheritanceContract.ts` with:
- `inheritanceABI` - Complete contract ABI
- `INHERITANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - Contract address constant
- `CONTRACT_INFO` - Deployment information

### Sample Frontend Integration:
```typescript
import { inheritanceABI, INHERITANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from '@/lib/abis/InheritanceContract';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Create contract instance
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(INHERITANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, inheritanceABI, provider);

// Read contract data
const ownerCount = await contract.ownerCount();
const planDetails = await contract.getPlanDetails(ownerAddress);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. âœ… Contract deployed successfully
2. âœ… ABI extracted and integrated
3. âœ… Frontend ready for integration
4. ðŸ”„ Test contract functionality
5. ðŸ”„ Build frontend interface
6. ðŸ”„ Connect wallet integration
7. ðŸ”„ Test full user flow
